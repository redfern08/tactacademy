# TactAcademy

TactAcademy is built for firearm owners of all skill levels to learn basic firearm skills and more advanced safety, usage and handling skills.  It is also a platform where firearm owners can share their stories whether they are out on the range, participating in shooting competitions or are avid firearm collectors, each person's story is unique.  Join us and start sharing today!

## The App

This app works as a social platform for firearm owners.  You can create posts and share images of your events or range days!  Show off your collection if you wish!  Your choices are not limited

## Roadmap 
At the time of this writing, this app is in the early stages of development.  Here is a look at what I have planned for this app.
  - Share images and posts
  - Comment on images and have the ability to tag people
  - Improve the app overtime

At this stage, I will have a basic working app but plans for future improvement and development are in order.
